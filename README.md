# Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with Python
This repository hosts code examples (and some exercise) for the book *Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R (Christian P. Robert, George Casella), 2010*. I aim to convert the original R scripts provided in the book into Python language. 

Each notebook is named according to its corresponding chapter. The examples and the figures are typically named according to the corresponding number in the text itself in order to help orientation.
